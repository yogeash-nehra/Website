                <h2>Marae: Commercial Activities in Auckland & New Zealand</h2>
<p>Marae, the traditional meeting grounds of the Māori people, are deeply rooted in cultural heritage and serve as spiritual and communal hubs for Māori communities. Traditionally, marae have been spaces for important gatherings, ceremonies, and celebrations.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, they have also evolved to incorporate a range of commercial activities that allow them to remain financially sustainable while continuing to serve as cultural strongholds. Across New Zealand, marae now host an array of commercial enterprises, including cultural tourism, educational workshops, wellness programs, and accommodation services.</p>
<p>These initiatives not only generate revenue for the marae but also foster cultural exchange, helping visitors gain a deeper understanding of Māori traditions, history, and values. By blending tradition with innovation, marae continue to thrive in modern society, offering experiences that are both immersive and educational.</p>
<h2>Indigenous Tourism- Private Small Group Tours </h2>

<p>Marae-based cultural tourism offers visitors authentic experiences of Māori culture and traditions. At Wolfgramm Holdings, their Marae Day Workshop immerses teams in Māori culture, strengthening connections, fostering unity, and creating meaningful cross-cultural understanding.</p>
<p>These immersive experiences often include traditional welcomes (powhiri), cultural performances, and hāngī meals.</p>

<ul>
<li>Visitors can participate in interactive activities exploring Māori stories, songs, and basic Te Reo Māori language.</li>

</ul>
<p>## Kotahitanga Principles of Leadership Workshop</p>

<p>Participants engage in wānanga (learning sessions) at beautiful marae across the country, exploring concepts like whakawhanaungatanga (relationship building) and the importance of mauri (life force) in organizational leadership</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs often include pōwhiri (welcome ceremonies), cultural performances, history lessons, specialized workshops and hangi meals.\</li>
<li>Leaders gain insights into Māori worldviews and their application to modern business challenges.</li>
<li>Workshops cover topics such as communication, facilitation, and building influence within diverse teams.</li>

<li>These experiences foster a deeper understanding of bicultural leadership in Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
</ul>
<h2>Haka & Waiata Workshops</h2>
<p>Māori performing arts, known as kapa haka, are showcased in various events throughout New Zealand, offering visitors immersive cultural experiences.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of these events is Te Matatini, often referred to as the \"Olympics of kapa haka,\" which takes place biannually.</p>
<p>The next Te Matatini is scheduled for February 24 to March 1, 2025, in Taranaki, with tickets typically selling out quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Auckland Art Gallery hosts \"Marae in the Sky,\" an immersive dance and music performance centered on Matariki, featuring world-class choreography, waiata, and music.</li>
<li>Rotorua, known as the birthplace of Māori tourism, offers numerous cultural experiences, including performances at Te Puia.</li>
<li>The Auckland Museum and Waitangi Treaty Grounds provide daily cultural performances as part of their entry packages, offering insights into Māori culture through song, dance, and traditional weaponry demonstrations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Traditional Weaving Workshops</h2>
<p>Traditional Māori weaving demonstrations offer visitors a captivating glimpse into the ancient art of raranga, showcasing techniques like whatu, tāniko, and tukutuku.</p>
<p>These interactive experiences often take place at cultural centers, museums, and marae, where skilled weavers demonstrate the intricate process of creating kākahu (cloaks), kete (baskets), and whāriki (mats) using native materials such as harakeke (New Zealand flax).</p>
<p>Visitors can observe the meticulous preparation of fibers, learn about the cultural significance of different patterns, and in some cases, participate in hands-on workshops to create their own small woven taonga (treasure).</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrations often include explanations of tikanga (protocols) associated with harvesting and weaving.</li>
<li>Many venues, like Te Puia in Rotorua, offer regular weaving demonstrations as part of their cultural experiences.</li>
<li>Some workshops allow participants to create their own small kete or flax flowers in these sessions.</li>
<li>These experiences not only preserve traditional skills but also promote understanding of Māori culture and values.\</li>
</ul>
<h2>Marae Poi Workshops</h2>
<p>Poi making classes at marae offer visitors an immersive cultural experience, combining traditional craftsmanship with storytelling.</p>
<p>These workshops, led by skilled artisans like Shelly Bell and Tia Bell, teach participants how to create their own poi using both traditional and modern materials.</p>
<p>Attendees learn about the rich whakapapa (genealogy) of poi, its cultural significance, and its evolution from a warrior training tool to a performance art.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes typically cover the creation of both short and long poi.\</li>
<li>Participants learn to weave cords, form the poi head, and attach tassels.\</li>
<li>Some workshops, like those at Wolfgramm Holdings, explore the connection between poi and Māori visual arts.\</li>
<li>Family-friendly sessions encourage intergenerational learning and cultural appreciation.\</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indigenous Wellbeing Workshops</h2>
<p>Marae-based wellbeing workshops are increasingly popular, offering holistic approaches to health grounded in Te Ao Māori perspectives. These workshops often combine traditional Māori healing practices with modern wellness concepts, addressing physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health.</p>
<p>Manawa Ora Mirimiri, for example, facilitates workplace training that introduces participants to Rongoā Māori, Mirimiri, and Romiromi, teaching wellness from a uniquely cultural standpoint.</p>
<p>Many of these workshops emphasize the importance of connecting with the whenua (land) and wai (water), promoting physical activity outdoors as a means of enhancing overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>Some programs, like the Whai Oranga initiative at Taahuna Pa Marae, pair individuals with long-term health conditions with personal trainers, fostering reciprocal learning experiences that encompass fitness goals and Māori cultural knowledge.</p>
<p>These marae-based services not only support individual health but also strengthen community bonds and cultural connections, embodying the whānau-centered approach central to Māori concepts of wellbeing.</p>

<p>Hāngī, the traditional Māori earth oven cooking method, has evolved into a popular catering option and cultural experience for both locals and tourists. Many Māori-owned businesses now offer hāngī catering services for events and celebrations, providing authentic, steam-cooked meals prepared in the traditional manner.</p>
<p>These services often include not just the food, but also cultural performances and educational components, allowing guests to learn about Māori customs and traditions while enjoying the feast.</p>
<p>Hāngī workshops and experiences are available in various locations, such as Rotorua, where visitors can participate in the preparation process and learn about the cultural significance of this cooking method.\</p>
<p>Some venues, like the Tūpuna Maunga Authority in Auckland, offer bookable hāngī pits where groups can prepare their own hāngī under expert guidance, fostering community engagement and cultural exchange.\</p>
<p>Innovative approaches to hāngī, such as fusion cuisine and modernized cooking techniques, are being explored by Māori chefs to bring this traditional method to a wider audience while maintaining its cultural integrity.</p>
