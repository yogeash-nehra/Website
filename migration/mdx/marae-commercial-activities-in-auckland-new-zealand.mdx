## Marae: Commercial Activities in Auckland & New Zealand

Marae, the traditional meeting grounds of the Māori people, are deeply rooted in cultural heritage and serve as spiritual and communal hubs for Māori communities. Traditionally, marae have been spaces for important gatherings, ceremonies, and celebrations. 

However, in recent years, they have also evolved to incorporate a range of commercial activities that allow them to remain financially sustainable while continuing to serve as cultural strongholds. Across New Zealand, marae now host an array of commercial enterprises, including cultural tourism, educational workshops, wellness programs, and accommodation services. 

These initiatives not only generate revenue for the marae but also foster cultural exchange, helping visitors gain a deeper understanding of Māori traditions, history, and values. By blending tradition with innovation, marae continue to thrive in modern society, offering experiences that are both immersive and educational.
