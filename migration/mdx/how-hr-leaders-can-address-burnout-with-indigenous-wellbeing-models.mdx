### How HR Leaders Can Address Burnout with Indigenous Wellbeing Models

Burnout is no longer a fringe issue. It's one of the most pressing challenges facing workplaces today. For HR leaders, the signs are everywhere: staff turnover creeping up, absenteeism increasing, engagement surveys showing fatigue and disengagement. Traditional wellness initiatives - gym discounts, mindfulness apps, free fruit in the lunchroom - are no longer enough.

What if the solution lies not in adding another perk, but in re-thinking wellbeing from the ground up?

### Moving Beyond Individual Fixes

Most corporate wellbeing models focus on the individual: take time off, download a meditation app, build personal resilience. While useful, these approaches don't address the systems that contribute to burnout in the first place - workload expectations, lack of belonging, and disconnection from purpose.

This is where indigenous wellbeing models offer fresh insight. They recognise that wellbeing is not just about the individual, but about relationships, balance, and collective strength.

### Indigenous Perspectives on Wellbeing

Māori models of wellbeing, such as Te Whare Tapa Whā (the four-cornered house) and Te Wheke (the octopus model), provide frameworks that HR leaders can apply directly to organisational culture.

- **Whanaungatanga (relationships)** -- Building belonging through strong connections. Staff who feel part of a whānau are less likely to burn out.\
  \
- **Wairua (spirituality and purpose)** -- Recognising that work is more than tasks; people thrive when their values and identity are acknowledged.\
  \
- **Tinana (physical wellbeing)** -- Supporting health beyond the office, ensuring rest, movement, and balance.\
  \
- **Hinengaro (mental and emotional health)** -- Normalising conversations about stress, creating safe spaces for support.

When organisations embed these principles, wellbeing shifts from being a "programme" to being a way of working.

### Practical Steps for HR Leaders

1.  **Redesign policies with balance in mind** -- Flexible hours, meeting-free days, and realistic workload management signal that staff wellbeing is prioritised.\
    \
2.  **Invest in relational culture** -- Team days, marae-based learning, and shared experiences strengthen connection and belonging.\
    \
3.  **Embed cultural models into leadership training** -- Leaders who understand holistic wellbeing are better equipped to notice and respond to burnout early.\
    \
4.  **Measure what matters** -- Move beyond KPIs of productivity alone; track engagement, belonging, and cultural safety as indicators of organisational health.

### Why This Matters Now

HR leaders who embrace indigenous wellbeing models aren't just ticking a box. They're future-proofing their organisations. A workforce that feels seen, valued, and supported is more innovative, more resilient, and more loyal.

Burnout thrives in disconnection. Wellbeing grows in connection. Indigenous models show us that when people feel like they belong, they don't just survive - they thrive.
