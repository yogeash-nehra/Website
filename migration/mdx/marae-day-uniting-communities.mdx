Marae are more than just physical gathering spaces; they are the beating heart of Māori communities, deeply rooted in cultural traditions, resilience, and connection. These sacred meeting grounds serve as centers of cultural excellence, knowledge transmission, and community support, playing a crucial role in uniting people from all walks of life.

In contemporary New Zealand, marae continue to evolve, extending their influence beyond traditional ceremonies and tangihanga (funerals) to encompass education, emergency response, economic development, and disaster preparedness. They foster a deep sense of whakawhanaungatanga---relationship-building---by welcoming schools, hosting cultural programs, and supporting whānau through challenging times.

This article explores the multifaceted roles marae play, highlighting their contributions to education, crisis response, and economic empowerment. As these institutions adapt to modern needs while preserving their cultural essence, they remain essential pillars of strength, unity, and identity for both Māori and non-Māori communities.

## Marae: Whakawhanauangatanga Through School Visits 

<figure id="figure-hed1zp3zeem7ky1qbz">
<img src="mdx/media/b15be650c6016f978d863af23745f560f3b81b35.png" id="hed1zp3zeem7ky1qbz" class="object-cover bg-gray-100 rounded-2xl md:rounded-3xl lg:rounded-4xl" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-position: center center;" data-corners="default" data-aspect="16:9" data-caption="" data-positionx="undefined" data-positiony="undefined" data-fullwidth="false" data-mce-src="https://cdn.durable.co/blocks/1azHeM46yeAlfaT7Xd36Hwu6TCrjOIFBjwjLsoeSr1IYHQOFbbpDwY9LniGMKIof.png" data-mce-style="aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-position: center center;" />

Whakawhanaungatanga, the Māori concept of building relationships and bringing people together, is exemplified through school visits to marae. These visits provide authentic learning experiences for students, connecting them with their culture, identity, and language.

At Te Pā Wānanga, a bilingual class located on Omaka Marae in Blenheim, students spend time in the wharenui learning about te ao Māori, including waiata and karakia, which deepens their understanding of their heritage and connection to the marae.

These marae-based learning programs foster strong relationships between schools, whānau, and the local community. Students grow more confident in their cultural identity, with their \"chins up, their eyes wide open,\" as they remain immersed in te ao Māori throughout the school day.

The inclusive learning environment encourages whānau participation, allowing families to observe, engage, and learn alongside their children, strengthening the bonds between generations and the wider community.

## Marae as Emergency Shelters

Marae play a crucial role as emergency shelters during natural disasters and crises in New Zealand. These cultural hubs often serve as trusted community centers, providing essential services such as shelter, food, and care to whānau and the wider public.

During emergencies, marae mobilize rapidly, demonstrating effective emergency management and relief efforts despite limited resources.

Marae have become local emergency response centers, capable of feeding up to a thousand people daily during disasters.\
They offer a face-to-face approach to recovery, providing a focal point for both the local Māori community and civil defense teams.\
Many marae are working to increase their resilience by installing solar panels, water tanks, and communication systems like Starlink.\

The Cultural Initiatives Fund and Marae Infrastructure Programme provide support for marae development projects, enhancing their ability to serve as emergency shelters.

## Marae-Led Disaster Preparedness

Marae play a crucial role in disaster preparedness and response across Aotearoa New Zealand, serving as vital hubs for community resilience. 

Many regions are implementing marae preparedness plans to enhance their capacity to support communities during emergencies.

These plans typically involve identifying potential hazards, cataloging available resources, and establishing links with emergency agencies.

- Marae often become default emergency shelters, providing food, accommodation, and cultural support to affected communities.
- Initiatives like the Ipu Ohotata (emergency containers) program in Te Tauihu equip marae with essential supplies for disaster response.
- Some marae are investing in self-sufficiency measures such as solar panels, water tanks, and satellite communication systems to improve their resilience.
- Despite their critical role, many marae face challenges in receiving adequate support and recognition from government agencies for their emergency response efforts.

## Marae: Community Resilience in Crises Situations

Marae play a pivotal role in enhancing community resilience during crises, serving as vital hubs for support and recovery. Recent research has revealed that one in three marae are at risk of flooding, one in three are in landslide-prone areas, and one in five are in tsunami evacuation zones.

Despite these challenges, marae have consistently demonstrated their ability to mobilize rapidly and provide effective emergency management during natural disasters. To strengthen marae resilience, initiatives such as the Marae Emergency Preparedness Plan are being implemented across New Zealand. 

These plans help marae identify potential hazards, catalog available resources, and establish links with emergency agencies.Some marae are also investing in self-sufficiency measures, including installing water tanks, solar panels, and satellite communication systems.

However, there is a growing recognition that marae often do not receive adequate support from government agencies in return for their crucial community service during crises, highlighting the need for formalized iwi involvement in Civil Defence Emergency Management structures.

## Marae Oranga & Cultural Revitalization

<figure id="figure-6jamcdyvglm7ky2lfv">
<img src="mdx/media/67d3d223dd805603d398a85ba4ac620f8ab032a1.jpg" id="6jamcdyvglm7ky2lfv" class="object-cover bg-gray-100 rounded-2xl md:rounded-3xl lg:rounded-4xl" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-position: 50% 45%;" data-corners="default" data-aspect="16:9" data-caption="" data-positionx="50%" data-positiony="45%" data-fullwidth="false" data-mce-src="https://cdn.durable.co/blocks/6X0yujD18rn6Vd1kCpbA35zfU7apiV796cAcvbsj1ELmcWPapiwiqquOkYu0U6jl.jpg" data-mce-style="aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-position: 50% 45%;" />
</figure>

The Oranga Marae programme, a joint initiative between Te Puni Kōkiri and the Department of Internal Affairs, supports the physical and cultural revitalization of marae as centers of Māori identity and mātauranga.

This initiative provides funding, advice, and support for marae development projects, including building renovations and activities to restore cultural knowledge. The programme aims to strengthen marae\'s ability to pass on ancestral knowledge of whaikōrero, karanga, and local mātauranga, tikanga, and kawa to descendants.

Key aspects of the Oranga Marae programme include:

- Support for marae affected by natural disasters or climate change.\
  Addressing health and safety concerns and compliance issues.
- Building relationships and partnering opportunities to support marae development.
- Funding for cultural revitalization activities to help preserve and share Māori heritage.
- Utilization of technology, such as the Te Rererunga application, which allows iwi to record, document, and share their unique cultural heritage through 3D capture and visualization.\

## Marae: Learning Tikanga Through Experience

<figure id="figure-ow1xkn0vzhm7ky3g1e">
<img src="mdx/media/9226476858304e3499e49c7a74d729f98ccd0f60.jpg" id="ow1xkn0vzhm7ky3g1e" class="object-cover bg-gray-100 rounded-2xl md:rounded-3xl lg:rounded-4xl" style="aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-position: center center;" data-corners="default" data-aspect="16:9" data-caption="" data-positionx="undefined" data-positiony="undefined" data-fullwidth="false" />
</figure>

Experiential learning plays a crucial role in understanding tikanga Māori, offering a deeper and more meaningful connection to Māori customs and protocols. Marae-based learning provides an immersive environment where theory meets practice, allowing learners to experience te ao Māori firsthand.

This approach enables students to participate in pōwhiri, practice mihimihi and pēpeha, and improve their spoken te reo Māori through waiata and group activities. The experiential learning cycle enhances personal growth by encouraging learners to think critically, reflect on their experiences, and apply their understanding to new situations.

This process not only deepens conceptual understanding of tikanga but also develops interpersonal skills and cultural competence. Programmes like He Papa Tikanga offer insights into Māori worldviews, traditions, and values, allowing learners to apply these concepts in their homes, workplaces, and communities.

## Marae: Economic Benefits & Opportunities

Marae day visits offer significant economic opportunities for Māori communities, providing a platform for sustainable tourism and local business development. 

These visits create employment opportunities for rangatahi, enabling them to pursue careers in their local areas while preserving and sharing their cultural heritage.

Kohutapu Lodge and Tribal Tours in Murupara exemplifies this approach, offering authentic \"real people tourism\" experiences that immerse visitors in modern Māori community life.

- Marae-based tourism initiatives generate income for whānau and contribute to regional economic development.
- Funds earned from hosting international tourists are often reinvested in the community, supporting scholarships, work-training programs, and local infrastructure.
- The Provincial Growth Fund has invested in Māori-led businesses and infrastructure development in communities with high Māori populations, stimulating economic growth and job creation.
- These initiatives not only provide economic benefits but also foster cultural pride and enable cross-cultural exchanges, contributing to the overall wellbeing and self-determination of Māori communities.

## Conclusion

Marae remain indispensable to the cultural, social, and economic fabric of Aotearoa New Zealand. Whether serving as learning hubs for tamariki, safe havens during crises, or catalysts for economic growth, they continue to embody the values of manaakitanga (hospitality), kotahitanga (unity), and resilience.

Despite facing challenges such as climate threats and limited government recognition, marae persist in their mission to uplift and protect their communities. 

Initiatives like Oranga Marae, emergency preparedness programs, and cultural revitalization efforts are crucial in ensuring these sacred spaces remain strong for future generations.

As we look ahead, it is essential to acknowledge and support the vital role of marae in fostering a connected, resilient, and culturally rich society. By strengthening these institutions, we honor the past, empower the present, and secure a vibrant future for all who call Aotearoa home.
