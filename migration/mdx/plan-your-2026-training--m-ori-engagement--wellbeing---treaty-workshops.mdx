### Plan Your 2026 Training: M캐ori Engagement, Wellbeing & Treaty Workshops

The most effective organisations don't leave cultural training to chance. They plan for it - building it into their leadership calendar, budgeting for it in advance, and signalling to staff and stakeholders that cultural capability is a priority.

With 2026 fast approaching, now is the time for boards, HR leaders, and managers to secure their place in the Wolfgramm Holdings training calendar.
