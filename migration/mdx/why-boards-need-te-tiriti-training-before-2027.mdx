### Why Boards Need Te Tiriti Training Before 2027

Governance in Aotearoa New Zealand is changing. Boards are expected to show not only financial stewardship but also cultural integrity, social accountability, and a clear understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

For directors, this is no longer optional. By 2027, Treaty literacy will be an essential part of governance practice - expected by regulators, investors, employees, and communities alike. Boards that act early will be positioned as leaders. Boards that delay risk being left behind.

### The Governance Imperative

Every decision a board makes - whether in procurement, partnerships, or community engagement - is shaped by context. In Aotearoa, that context includes Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Without competence in this area, boards risk blind spots that can lead to reputational harm, strained relationships, or missed opportunities.

### Why 2027 Is the Tipping Point

Several forces are converging:

- **Legislation and regulation** -- Policy settings are increasingly embedding Treaty obligations into governance frameworks.\
  \
- **Investor and market pressure** -- ESG reporting now looks at cultural and social accountability alongside financial results.\
  \
- **Public expectation** -- Employees, customers, and communities want to see boards demonstrating genuine partnership, not just rhetoric.

By 2027, boards that lack Treaty training will be exposed to risk.

### What Te Tiriti Training Offers Boards

1.  **Clarity** -- A grounded understanding of Treaty principles and their governance relevance.\
    \
2.  **Confidence** -- The ability to engage on cultural issues without hesitation.\
    \
3.  **Connection** -- Authentic, values-based relationships with iwi, hapū, and Māori stakeholders.\
    \
4.  **Capability** -- Governance strategies that align both business performance and cultural responsibility.

### From Compliance to Leadership

Te Tiriti training is not about ticking a box. It's about shaping resilient governance that stands up to scrutiny and builds trust. Boards that invest now will not only reduce risk but also unlock opportunities for growth, innovation, and stronger community partnerships.

### A Call to Action for Directors

If you serve on a board, the question is no longer if you need Te Tiriti training, but when. Waiting until 2027 is too late.

At Wolfgramm Holdings, we deliver tailored governance training that equips directors with the tools, context, and confidence to lead responsibly.
