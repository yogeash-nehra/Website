### Introduction

Workplace inclusion has become a business imperative in Aotearoa New Zealand. Organisations are under increasing pressure to create environments where people from all backgrounds feel respected, valued, and able to contribute fully. While many businesses turn to generic diversity and inclusion programmes, a uniquely powerful approach is emerging: marae-based training. Rooted in M캐ori cultural practice, it offers more than a workshop --- it provides an experience that transforms relationships, perspectives, and workplace culture.

### 1. Why the Marae Matters

The marae is more than a venue. It is the spiritual, cultural, and physical heart of M캐ori communities. Hosting training in this environment allows participants to experience tikanga (protocols), kawa (customs), and whanaungatanga (relationships) in a living, authentic setting. Unlike traditional conference rooms, the marae immerses people in the values that underpin genuine connection and inclusion.

### 2. Moving Beyond "Tick-Box" Training

Many traditional diversity initiatives can feel like compliance exercises. Marae-based training moves beyond policy to practice. Participants are welcomed through p콄whiri or whakatau, engage in dialogue within the wharenui (meeting house), and share kai (food) together. These experiences break down barriers, foster mutual respect, and leave a lasting imprint that no PowerPoint slide could replicate.

### 3. The Business Benefits of Cultural Immersion

Inclusive workplaces are more innovative, resilient, and productive. Research shows that cultural confidence improves staff retention, strengthens leadership, and builds trust with customers and communities. Marae-based training directly supports these outcomes by:

- Building cultural capability across teams

- Strengthening understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi responsibilities

- Improving communication and collaboration in diverse settings

- Enhancing wellbeing and a sense of belonging\
  

  ### 4. Why This Matters for the Future of Work

  [The future of New Zealand workplaces is deeply tied to our bicultural foundations and our growing multicultural reality. Businesses that engage with M캐ori values and practices position themselves as forward-thinking and socially responsible. Marae-based training is not just about today's compliance --- it's about tomorrow's competitive advantage.]{style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 18px; font-weight: inherit;" mce-style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 18px; font-weight: inherit;"}

### Conclusion

Marae-based training represents a shift from theory to lived experience. By embedding cultural capability within authentic M캐ori spaces, organisations can move from inclusion as a policy to inclusion as a practice.
