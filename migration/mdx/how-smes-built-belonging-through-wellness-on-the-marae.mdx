## How SMEs Built Belonging Through Wellness on the Marae (meeting grounds)

### Intro:

Many New Zealand SMEs want to build confident, culturally aware teams but do not know where to start. Leaders tell us they worry about getting it wrong or using the wrong kupu (words), which creates hesitation rather than progress. This case study shows a simple pathway that replaced uncertainty with confident action in 30 days.

### The challenge

The team had good intent but low confidence. Meetings opened awkwardly, welcoming visitors felt inconsistent, and staff were unsure how tikanga (customs and correct ways of doing things) should guide decisions at work.

### Why a marae (meeting grounds) based approach works

Learning on a marae (meeting grounds) brings people into a living space of tikanga (customs) and kawa (protocols). It creates psychological safety, turns protocols into everyday practice, and connects teams with the why behind each action. People experience manaakitanga (care and hospitality) and whanaungatanga (relationships and connection) in real time rather than only talking about them.

- Practical and relevant for NZ workplaces
- Grounded in tikanga (customs) and kawa (protocols)
- Designed for confidence, not perfection

### What we did

We ran a three part learning pathway. Each session layered knowledge with practice so people left with actions they could use the next working day.

**Session 1: Understanding Māori Cultural Engagement Practices**

An introduction to tikanga (customs), kawa (protocols), hui (meetings/gatherings), and pepeha (cultural introductions)\
Tailored for non-Māori organisations. Participants learned everyday protocols for welcomes, introductions, and meetings that build respect and clarity.

**Session 2: Pōwhiri (formal welcome ceremony) and Whakatau (informal welcome) Readiness**

A deep dive into formal and informal welcomes. Teams practiced roles, language, and flow so they can participate with confidence at a marae (meeting grounds) or host visitors at work with care.

**Session 3: Mana Motuhake (self-determination) for practical decision making**

Exploring the concept of mana motuhake (self-determination) and how it informs good decision making in SMEs. We mapped practical scenarios, from team stand ups to client meetings, so people could align process with purpose.

Alongside the sessions, participants experienced an official pōwhiri (formal welcome ceremony) and a short history kōrero (talk) about the marae (meeting grounds) and its environs.

### Results in 30 days

- More confident introductions and mihi (greetings/acknowledgements) in meetings
- Clearer roles during welcomes and events
- Stronger sense of belonging and shared purpose
- Managers observed more engaged participation and fewer avoidant behaviours
  - "Belonging grows when people know how to show up."\

### Lessons for HR and People leaders

1.  Start with shared foundations. Give everyone the same baseline of tikanga (customs) and kawa (protocols).
2.  Practice, not just learn. Rehearse greetings, welcomes, and hui (meeting) flow until it is second nature.
3.  Tie it to decisions. Link each protocol to daily business choices so the learning travels back to the office.
4.  Make it safe to learn. Normalise questions and practice time. Confidence follows practice.
5.  Keep the momentum. Follow up with short refreshers and visible rituals that reinforce the shift.\

### Who should attend

- HR and People leaders who set culture and onboarding
- Team leads and client facing staff
- Executives who sponsor inclusion and want a practical pathway

### Next steps

If you want a similar outcome for your team, we recommend a one day marae (meeting grounds) based workshop that includes the three sessions above, a pōwhiri (formal welcome ceremony), and a guided history kōrero (talk). We tailor scenarios to your sector and current challenges.
