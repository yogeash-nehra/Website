## Marae: Indigenous Storytelling Is in Our DNA

Storytelling, deeply rooted in Māori culture, serves as a vital tool for preserving history, transmitting knowledge, and promoting well-being. 

This ancient practice of sharing pūrākau (traditional stories) not only connects generations but also plays a crucial role in maintaining cultural identity, language, and spiritual beliefs in contemporary Māori society.

## Storytelling: How We Can Empower Māori Identity

Pūrākau, as a form of Māori storytelling, plays a crucial role in empowering cultural identity and fostering a sense of belonging among Māori people, especially rangatahi (youth). These narratives serve as windows into the past, guiding future generations with ancestral wisdom and connecting individuals to their whakapapa (genealogy).

By engaging with pūrākau, Māori youth can develop a deeper understanding of their heritage and cultivate pride in their identity. This connection to cultural stories and traditions has been shown to have significant psychological benefits, helping individuals externalize difficulties and find reassurance in the shared experiences of their tīpuna (ancestors).

Moreover, the practice of sharing and engaging with pūrākau in educational and community settings fosters a collective spirit, strengthening bonds within whānau (family) and wider Māori society.

## Pūrākau In Therapeutic Practice

- Pūrākau, traditional Māori storytelling, has emerged as a powerful therapeutic tool in mental health settings, offering a culturally relevant approach to healing and well-being. 
- This practice, known as \"mahi ā ngā atua\" (the deeds of the gods), involves sharing traditional stories featuring atua (gods) with tangata whaiora (mental health clients) and their whānau (family), followed by wānanga (discussion and debate) to explore the embedded knowledge and meanings.
- The therapeutic process allows clients to retell and creatively represent pūrākau through various mediums such as waiata (songs), haka (dance), poetry, or visual arts, connecting their personal experiences to ancestral wisdom.
- Pūrākau in therapy helps build self-worth, empowers with knowledge, and offers a culturally specific healing process.\
- It provides a framework for discussing psychological distress and trauma through archetypal characters.\
- The approach enhances cultural identity, sense of belonging, and leadership skills in various contexts, including sports teams.\
- Clinicians use pūrākau as an engagement tool, assessment framework, and intervention process, emphasizing Māori voices and cultural practices. 
- Research suggests that pūrākau therapy can benefit both Māori and non-Māori clients, offering a valuable complement to Western psychological models.

## Pūrākau in Mental Health

Pūrākau, traditional Māori storytelling, has gained recognition as a powerful tool in mental health treatment within Aotearoa New Zealand. This approach offers a culturally affirming alternative to Western psychiatric methods, emphasizing Māori worldviews of health and well-being.

The Mahi a Atua program, developed by Māori psychiatrist Diana Maree Kopua and Tohunga Mark A Kopua, integrates pūrākau into mental health services, providing a framework that resonates with Māori clients and their whānau.

- Pūrākau in therapy helps remove cultural shame and gives mana to Māori patients by comparing their situations to those of their tūpuna (ancestors).
- The Toka Āhuru framework guides clinicians in using pūrākau effectively, encouraging understanding of both the stories and their place in te ao Māori worldview.
- This approach aligns with Māori models of health, such as Te Whare Tapa Whā, addressing spiritual, physical, and emotional well-being holistically.
- Research indicates that pūrākau can benefit both Māori and non-Māori clients, offering a valuable complement to conventional psychological approaches.\

## Pūrākau: Healing Through Ancestral Narratives

Pūrākau, as a form of ancestral storytelling, offers a powerful pathway to healing and reconnection with Māori cultural identity. This approach, rooted in Indigenous knowledge, provides a unique framework for addressing mental health challenges by drawing on the wisdom of tūpuna (ancestors) and mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge).

The practice of sharing and engaging with pūrākau allows individuals to contextualize their personal struggles within a broader cultural narrative, often leading to transformative outcomes in overcoming addictions, addressing violent situations, and improving interpersonal relationships.

- Pūrākau helps ignite \"knew knowledge\" - ancestral wisdom that resides within Māori DNA, waiting to be awakened.\
- The approach aligns with Māori worldviews of health, emphasizing the interconnectedness of spiritual, physical, and emotional well-being.
- Engaging with pūrākau can help externalise difficulties and reduce feelings of isolation by connecting individuals to shared ancestral experiences. 
- This method of healing through storytelling is gaining recognition internationally, with Māori practitioners invited to share their insights at global forums like COP28.

## Pūrākau:  Oral Traditions & Whakapapa

Whakapapa, the Māori concept of genealogy, is deeply embedded in oral traditions and serves as a fundamental framework for understanding identity, history, and connections to the natural world. 

Traditionally transmitted orally, whakapapa links individuals to their ancestors, land, and the universe through various storytelling methods such as tararere (single line of descent) and tātai hikohiko (short genealogies of important ancestors).

These oral narratives often intertwine with creation stories, connecting people to gods and mythical figures, reinforcing cultural bonds and ensuring the continuity of Māori knowledge.

- Whakapapa is recalled through waiata (songs), particularly oriori sung to children, and stories that connect genealogy to the landscape.\
- Experts used rākau whakapapa, notched sticks, as memory aids when reciting names.
- The wharenui (meeting house) serves as a physical representation of whakapapa, with the oldest ancestors at the top and recent lineages at the bottom.
- This oral tradition fosters a sense of belonging, grounds people to the earth, and provides a framework for understanding one\'s place in the world.\

## Story Telling: How We Will Use Our indigenous knowledge & Artificial Intelligence

In recent years, Māori storytellers have embraced digital technologies to preserve and share their cultural narratives. The Arataki Cultural Trails app, developed by Māori tech company Arataki Systems, allows users to listen to historical and cultural stories at significant sites in the Bay of Plenty and beyond, reinvigorating the vital oral tradition of Māori storytelling.

This innovative approach not only preserves important stories for future generations but also makes them accessible to a wider audience. Digital storytelling has also emerged as a powerful method for Māori to express their experiences, particularly in healthcare settings. 

Research has shown that digital storytelling can be an effective tool for Māori to share their experiences of providing end-of-life caregiving, aligning with the oral/aural nature of Māori society.

Additionally, digital technologies are being used to archive waiata and haka, ensuring the preservation of these essential cultural expressions. These modern tools are helping to bridge the gap between traditional storytelling methods and contemporary media, allowing Māori to maintain their cultural heritage while adapting to the digital age.

## Storytelling: Using Marae to Bolster The Economy

Marae, as cultural hubs for Māori communities, are increasingly leveraging storytelling traditions to create economic opportunities. The Oranga Marae programme, supported by the New Zealand government, aims to revitalize marae and strengthen their ability to pass on ancestral knowledge, including storytelling practices.

This initiative has led to the development of tourism experiences owned and operated by whānau, hapū, or iwi, employing locals to share their stories authentically. These storytelling-based tourism ventures not only generate income but also contribute to cultural preservation and community well-being. For instance, some marae have created jobs for tradespeople and contractors through renovation projects, while others have developed cultural tourism experiences that showcase Māori heritage and traditions. 

This approach aligns with the Māori concept of \"Ka Mua, Ka Muri\" - walking backward into the future - by using traditional storytelling to create sustainable economic opportunities while preserving and promoting cultural identity.

## Conclusion

Storytelling remains at the heart of Māori culture, serving as a bridge between generations, a tool for healing, and a means of preserving identity in an evolving world. 

From pūrākau in therapeutic settings to digital innovations and economic empowerment through marae-based initiatives, the practice of storytelling continues to adapt while staying deeply rooted in whakapapa and mātauranga Māori. 

By embracing both traditional and modern storytelling methods, Māori communities are ensuring that their voices, histories, and wisdom endure for future generations. 

As storytelling is woven into every aspect of Māori life, it remains a testament to the resilience, strength, and vibrancy of Indigenous knowledge---guiding the way forward while honoring the past.
