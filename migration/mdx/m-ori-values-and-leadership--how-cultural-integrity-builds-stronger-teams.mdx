### Learn how Māori values like manaakitanga and kotahitanga can transform leadership, trust, and inclusion within New Zealand organisations.

Leadership today looks very different from what it did a decade ago. The challenges are more complex, the teams more diverse, and the expectations higher. Yet the qualities that define great leadership remain timeless - humility, empathy, and integrity.

In Aotearoa, these qualities are beautifully reflected in Māori values that have guided communities for generations. Values such as manaakitanga (care and respect), whanaungatanga (relationships and connection), and kotahitanga (unity and collective purpose) provide a powerful foundation for modern leadership. They remind us that leadership is not about control or authority. It is about responsibility, service, and the wellbeing of others.

At Wolfgramm Holdings, our Te Uru Tāngata Leadership Workshops bring these values to life inside today's workplaces. Through shared learning, reflection, and practical exercises, leaders experience what it means to lead with cultural integrity. They learn that leadership built on manaakitanga inspires trust, and leadership shaped by kotahitanga fosters collaboration and commitment.

True leadership is relational. It begins with how we treat people, not how we manage them. When leaders embody cultural values, they create a culture of belonging where people feel seen, supported, and valued. This sense of connection fuels performance, innovation, and loyalty across the organisation.

Cultural integrity in leadership is not a trend or an act of symbolism. It is a strategic advantage. It helps teams navigate uncertainty with confidence, resolve conflict through understanding, and make decisions that reflect both purpose and people. When values guide leadership, inclusion becomes natural and genuine.

Māori values also challenge leaders to redefine success. Instead of focusing only on profit or productivity, they invite leaders to consider wellbeing, sustainability, and intergenerational impact. This is leadership that looks beyond the quarter - leadership that grows better people.

The lessons of te ao Māori are universal. They teach that strength comes from unity, respect from service, and influence from integrity. When leaders live these values, they do more than manage teams. They nurture communities of care, creativity, and purpose.

### Because when leaders grow through culture, organisations thrive through connection.
